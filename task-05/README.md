### Client side errors and missing packages or namespace
1. added
- using System.Net;
- using System.Net.Sockets;

2. I have replaced Socket sender = new Socket(ipAddress.AddressFamily); by Socket sender = new Socket(AddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.Tcp);
3. Since name,interests and mail are of type string so I declared them as String name,interests and mail.
4. since we store group of messages I used msg[] of byte type
5. in main function Start() was changed to StartClient()
