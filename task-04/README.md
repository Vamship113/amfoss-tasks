1. Using botfather I created bot called movieyear_bot and generated API key
2. And using OMDb I generated Key and then stored it in .env file after intalling dotenv 
3. Then replaced it in bot.py for bot_id and OmDb key by getting env variables
4. Using request and json I stored the data in string and photo and then sent back the inform to the user 
5. Every time user searches for a movie the data is stored in a list
6. When user choose for export the data stored in list is stored in CSV and then return CSV back to user for download
