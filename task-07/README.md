## Attempted but not able to complete 
### below are the steps I followed
- Cloned the repository 
- installed go 
- In main.go I added the functions onclick for increment,decrease and reset
- In html I added Onclick="function()" for each click events
- generated wasm_exec.js using $ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm, cd task-07ARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm, ls "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" . and go run .dex.html&
- tried running go file but failed
